## 🛠 Skills

### 🔧 _Soft_
I engage myself in cultural transformation since my early days. I am a developer advocate and strongly belief into [Our Iceberg Is Melting](https://www.amazon.com/Our-Iceberg-Melting-Succeeding-Conditions/dp/0399563911). Everyday I try to learn and improve myself and my surroundings adhering to the [The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership](https://conscious.is/15-commitments). My strengths in these waters are:

- **Developer**: Recognize and cultivate potential in others
- **Communicator**: Speaking up and putting thoughts into words
- **Restorator**: Figuring out what's wrong and resolving it
- **Individualiser**: Figuring out how different people can work together
- **Activator**: Turning thoughts into action

### 🔨 _Hard_
I live by [the DevOps handbook](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002) and thus my hard skills are shaped around it.
