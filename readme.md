## 💻 Experience

What I am or have been working on...

### [sap.com](https://www.sap.com)

#### Product Team Lead 
<small>_MAY 2019 - MARCH 2020, ZÜRICH & REMOTE_</small>

Supporting the customer end to end was our vision with the new product I was hired for to develop. Me and two partners were in charge of three teams that should link different products in an orchestration layer, allowing customers to build workflows across applications - retaining the context. With a reorganization, the vision found its end but I left an impression and was encouraged to take my next role.

### [biovision.ch](https://www.biovision.ch)
<small>_JANUARY 2019 - APRIL 2019, ZÜRICH, ZIVILDIENST_</small>

Through community service I am supporting the Advocacy and Policy team of Biovision in their preparations for the UN Climate Summit in Costa Rica.

### [gravity.global](https://gravity.global) - CTO
<small>_APRIL 2018 - DECEMBER 2018, ZÜRICH_</small>

I was the lead architect for GRAVITY software (a digital adoption tool) and the first point-of-contact for our global customer base. I mobilized and guided the company’s team of developers into action, whether that was implementing customized technical solutions or making strategic product improvements. In a startup spirit I took over product owner responsibility from the CEO and actively collected user impressions to improve our overall user experience.

### [mila.com](https://www.mila.com) - Software Engineer
<small>_SEPTEMBER 2016 - MARCH 2018, ZÜRICH_</small>

We developed a crowd service platform with AngularJS, Web technologies, Node.js, Cloud Computing and Microservice Architectures using Scrum. 
Ad interim I took responsibility of the development team during the absence of a CTO taking care of daily business and project management tasks. I actively shaped  the next generation product and its architecture. 

### [fluance.ch](https://fluance.ch) - Software Developer
<small>_APRIL 2015 - AUGUST 2016, SOLOTHURN_</small>

## 🛠 Skills

### 🔧 _Soft_
I engage myself in cultural transformation since my early days. I am a developer advocate and strongly belief into [Our Iceberg Is Melting](https://www.amazon.com/Our-Iceberg-Melting-Succeeding-Conditions/dp/0399563911). Everyday I try to learn and improve myself and my surroundings adhering to the [The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership](https://conscious.is/15-commitments). My strengths in these waters are:

- **Developer**: I recognize and cultivate potential in others
- **Communicator**:I speak up and put thoughts into words
- **Restorator**: I figure out what's wrong and resolve it
- **Individualiser**: I figure out how different people can work together
- **Activator**: I turn thoughts into action

### 🔨 _Hard_
I live by [the DevOps handbook](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002) and thus my hard skills are shaped around it.
