## üíª Experience

### [abbts.ch](https://www.abbts.ch) - Part-time Lecturer
<small>_APRIL 2019 - present, BADEN & REMOTE_</small>

Bringing my everyday knowledge from Software Engineering back to two lectures, Software Design and Testing. Using DevOps as a guiding thread - together with other lecturers - I shape e-profile engineers that can build a production-grade application after 18 months of part-time study. Find my materials in [projects](#-projects).

### [sap.com](https://www.sap.com)
#### Head of Engineering [SAP Field Service Management](https://www.sap.com/products/field-service-management.html)
<small>_APRIL 2020 - present, Z√úRICH & REMOTE_</small>

Since you can't buy DevOps or its mindset it is our task to accompany our two-pizza teams journeys thereto. With a team of five we strive to enable all of our 100+ engineers to live DevOps. Shaping the self-service platform with tools like Kubernetes is the smaller part of our work, our main efforts focus around knowledge sharing, devtalking, documenting and guiding people within this _labyrinth_ of tooling a DevOps engineer needs. I would summarize our team as _the Ops liaison_ from the [the DevOps handbook](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002).

We setup 24/7 monitoring of our application primarily from Europe using a variant of [Googles SRE](https://sre.google/) called _SRE Tridems_ (because it consists of triplets of engineers). With the availability concerns mitigated in 2020 we focus on transforming our click- and ticket-driven infrastructure to _Infrastructure As Code_ - namely Bamboo to GitHub Actions and ArgoCD, PagerDuty, our GitHub Enterprise Organization or LaunchDarkly to `x-as-code` with Terraform. We have setup internal `sig`s - Special Interest Groups - to eagerly share knowledge as well as to build and nurture the culture around these setups, so that the engineers can self-service themselves within the DevOps ‚àû.

#### Product Team Lead 
<small>_MAY 2019 - MARCH 2020, Z√úRICH & REMOTE_</small>

Basing on the [`Window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) interface we leveraged [SAP Luigi](https://github.com/SAP/luigi) to develop cross-application framework that would transfer context between different everyday applications of [SAP Field Service Management](https://www.sap.com/products/field-service-management.html) users to ease up their flow and eradicate the need for the clipboard or worse, hand written notebooks. We went to observe customers, noted down where they would break their flow to lookup something somewhere and closed this experience gap.

<br/>

### [biovision.ch](https://www.biovision.ch)
<small>_JANUARY 2019 - APRIL 2019, Z√úRICH, ZIVILDIENST_</small>

Through community service I was supporting the Advocacy and Policy team of Biovision in their preparations for the UN Climate Summit in Costa Rica.

<br/>

### [gravity.global](https://gravity.global) - CTO
<small>_APRIL 2018 - DECEMBER 2018, Z√úRICH_</small>

I was the lead architect for GRAVITY software (a digital adoption tool) and the first point-of-contact for our global customer base. I mobilized and guided the company‚Äôs team of developers into action, whether that was implementing customized technical solutions or making strategic product improvements. In a startup spirit I took over product owner responsibility from the CEO and actively collected user impressions to improve our overall user experience.


<br/>

### [mila.com](https://www.mila.com) - Software Engineer
<small>_SEPTEMBER 2016 - MARCH 2018, Z√úRICH_</small>

We developed a crowd service platform with AngularJS, Web technologies, Node.js, Cloud Computing and Microservice Architectures using Scrum. 
Ad interim I took responsibility of the development team during the absence of a CTO taking care of daily business and project management tasks. I actively shaped  the next generation product and its architecture. 


<br/>

### [fluance.ch](https://fluance.ch) - Software Developer
<small>_APRIL 2015 - AUGUST 2016, SOLOTHURN_</small>

I worked on a patient aggregated web application with AngularJS, Web technologies and User Interaction Design using Scrum.

## üõ† Skills
### üîß _Soft_
Cultural transformation is a passion of mine since my early days. I am a developer advocate and strongly believe into [Our Iceberg Is Melting](https://www.amazon.com/Our-Iceberg-Melting-Succeeding-Conditions/dp/0399563911). Every day I try to learn and improve myself and my surroundings adhering to the [the 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership](https://conscious.is/15-commitments). My strengths in these areas are:

- **Developer**: I recognize and cultivate potential in others
- **Communicator**: I speak up and put thoughts into words
- **Restorator**: I figure out what's wrong and resolve it
- **Individualiser**: I figure out how different people can work together
- **Activator**: I turn thoughts into action

<br/>

### üî® _Hard_
I live by [the DevOps handbook](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002) and thus my hard skills are shaped around it.
