## 🛠 Skills
### 🔧 _Soft_
Cultural transformation is a passion of mine since my early days. I am a developer advocate and strongly believe into [Our Iceberg Is Melting](https://www.amazon.com/Our-Iceberg-Melting-Succeeding-Conditions/dp/0399563911). Every day I try to learn and improve myself and my surroundings adhering to the [the 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership](https://conscious.is/15-commitments). My strengths in these areas are:

- **Developer**: I recognize and cultivate potential in others
- **Communicator**: I speak up and put thoughts into words
- **Restorator**: I figure out what's wrong and resolve it
- **Individualiser**: I figure out how different people can work together
- **Activator**: I turn thoughts into action

<br/>

### 🔨 _Hard_
I live by [the DevOps handbook](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002) and thus my hard skills are shaped around it.
