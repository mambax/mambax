## 💻 Experience
### [sap.com](https://www.sap.com)
#### Head of Engineering [SAP Field Service Management](https://www.sap.com/products/field-service-management.html)
<small>_APRIL 2020 - present, ZÜRICH & REMOTE_</small>

Since you can't buy DevOps or its mindset, it is our task to accompany our two-pizza teams' journeys thereto. With a team of five we strive to enable all of our 100+ engineers to live DevOps. Nex to shaping the self-service platform with tools like Kubernetes, our main focus is on knowledge sharing, dev-talking, documenting and guiding people within the [labyrinth](https://landscape.cncf.io/) of tools a DevOps engineer needs. I would summarize our team as _the Ops liaison_ from the [the DevOps handbook](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002).

We set up 24/7 monitoring of our application primarily from EMEA using a variant of [Googles SRE](https://sre.google/) called _SRE Tridems_ (because it consists of triplets of engineers). After having mitigated availability concerns in 2020, we focus on transforming our click- and ticket-driven infrastructure to _Infrastructure As Code_ — namely Bamboo to GitHub Actions and ArgoCD, as well as PagerDuty, our GitHub Enterprise Organization or LaunchDarkly to `x-as-code` with Terraform. We have set up internal `sig`s — Special Interest Groups — to eagerly share knowledge as well as to build and nurture the culture around these setups, so that the engineers can self-serve themselves within the DevOps ∞.

#### Product Team Lead 
<small>_MAY 2019 - MARCH 2020, ZÜRICH & REMOTE_</small>

Leveraging [SAP Luigi](https://github.com/SAP/luigi) we developed a cross-application framework that transfers context between  everyday applications of [SAP Field Service Management](https://www.sap.com/products/field-service-management.html). This eases up their flow and eradicates the need for the clipboard or worse, hand-written notebooks. We observed customers, noting recurrent interruptions in their workflow and closed these gaps.

### [abbts.ch](https://www.abbts.ch) - Part-time Lecturer
<small>_APRIL 2019 - present, BADEN & REMOTE_</small>

<br/>

### [gravity.global](https://gravity.global) - CTO
<small>_APRIL 2018 - DECEMBER 2018, ZÜRICH_</small>

I was the lead architect for GRAVITY software (a digital adoption tool) and the first point-of-contact for our global customer base. I led the company’s team of developers through the initial development of the product, whether that was implementing customized technical solutions or making strategic improvements. In a startup spirit I took over product owner responsibility and actively collected user impressions to improve our overall user experience.

<br/>

### [mila.com](https://www.mila.com) - Software Engineer
<small>_SEPTEMBER 2016 - MARCH 2018, ZÜRICH_</small>

We developed a crowd service platform with AngularJS, Web technologies, Node.js, Cloud Computing and a Microservice Architecture using Scrum. 
Ad interim I took responsibility of the development team during the absence of the CTO, taking care of daily business and project management tasks. I actively shaped the next generation product and its architecture.

## 🛠 Skills
### 🔧 _Soft_
Cultural transformation is a passion of mine since my early days. I am a developer advocate and strongly believe into [Our Iceberg Is Melting](https://www.amazon.com/Our-Iceberg-Melting-Succeeding-Conditions/dp/0399563911). Every day I try to learn and improve myself and my surroundings adhering to the [the 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership](https://conscious.is/15-commitments). My strengths in these areas are:

- **Developer**: I recognize and cultivate potential in others
- **Communicator**: I speak up and put thoughts into words
- **Restorator**: I figure out what's wrong and resolve it
- **Individualiser**: I figure out how different people can work together
- **Activator**: I turn thoughts into action

<br/>

### 🔨 _Hard_
I live by [the DevOps handbook](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002) and thus my hard skills are shaped around it.
